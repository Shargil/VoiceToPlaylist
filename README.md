# VoiceToPlaylist
ðŸ’¡ How cool it would be if when you ask "Hey Google/ Siri/ Alexa, play music" it will play a Spotify playlist according to your actual mood?

âŒ› 4.5 hours project (quick and dirty) - Voice Emotion Recognizer that open up a Spotify playlist according to you mood. Works with regular voice recording, no integration to any smart speaker yet.

ðŸ“– Based on [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-speech-emotion-recognizer-using-python-4c1c7c89d713), it had a cool idea and I wanted to try it out (The code is basically copied from there).

P.S No idea if it works better then random :)
